- 👋 Hi, I’m @pcdilley
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and game design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and enhancing my capabilities with C++, Python, Bash, and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn best practices for ML by experimenting with some public repos. 
- 📫 You can reach me at my email address: paulcdilley@gmail.com.  If you'd like to collaborate, don't be shy about commenting on my repos or making pull requests.

The projects I currently want to pursue are an incremental game based on Evolve (https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/).  It's a great game itself and I'm hoping I can make a good sequel.  Another project is a music style transfer ML network.  I haven't figured out what the best architecture would be, but I suspect a beat/measure discriminator, then a DFT, then some persuasion of GAN (likely based on image style transfer GANs) would work best.
